title: Inverse Covariance Selection via ADMM
summary: In gaussian distributions, the inverse covariance matrix sheds some light on the conditional independence of each variable. Estimating it, in high dimensions, becomes computationally unfeasible very quickly. In this project, I investigate the distributed computing algorithm of the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
