At Uizard I work to bridge the gap between research and production. Design is a challenging domain. Often, during the exploration process, the amount of possible solutions grows exponentially, making the problem intractable which makes it hard to predict the user's intention prediction. On top of that, the nature of its data is highly multimodal, where text, images, and layouts are combined in thousands of ways. Finally, unlike academic research, these models must be productionize so long tail optimization is often needed. I approach these challenges by harnessing NLP, CV, and custom machine learning models.

Before joining Uizard I worked at 3Dintegrated applying computer vision to assisted robotic surgery.  

I studied an MSc in mathematical modeling at the Technical University of Denmark where I studied many diverse domains including, distributed computing, graph theory, optimization, machine learning, neuroscience, etc.
